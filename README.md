# Reference Library

Welcome to my **Reference Library** — a living textbook of everything I’m learning on the path to becoming a full-stack developer with a strong focus on security (AppSec / DevSecOps).  

This repo is the single source of truth for my GitBook space, so all notes here sync directly into a clean manual I can browse and share.  

---

## Purpose
This library is:
- My **personal manual** of definitions, notes, and explanations — all in my own words.  
- A structured way to **track progress** as I move from fundamentals to advanced topics.  
- A knowledge base I can expand forever, and reuse in projects, job prep, or quick reference.  

Think of it as my self-taught textbook.

## Structure
Each chapter lives in its own folder, with a dedicated `README.md` that introduces the topic and links to sub-pages.

1. [Foundations](01-foundations/README.md) — command line, Git, programming basics.  
2. [Programming Concepts](02-programming-concepts/README.md) — data structures, algorithms, OOP vs functional.  
3. [Web Basics](03-web-basics/README.md) — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP.  
4. [Frontend](04-frontend/README.md) — React, state management, routing.  
5. [Backend](05-backend/README.md) — Node.js, Express, APIs, databases.  
6. [Full Stack Integration](06-fullstack/README.md) — authentication, validation, error handling.  
7. [DevOps](07-devops/README.md) — environment variables, Docker, CI/CD.  
8. [Security](08-security/README.md) — secure coding, OWASP vulns, scanning tools.  
9. [Advanced](09-advanced/README.md) — caching, GraphQL, testing, monitoring.  
10. [Glossary](glossary/README.md) — quick alphabetized definitions.

## How I Use This
- **Edit locally** in Markdown (`.md`) files.  
- **Commit & push** to GitHub (`main` branch).  
- **Sync to GitBook** → my Reference Library space updates automatically.  

Every page uses a consistent template:
- TL;DR (summary)  
- Why it matters  
- Core ideas  
- Example (code or concept)  
- Common pitfalls  
- Quick checklist  
- See also  

---

## Future Plans
- Fill in every section with progressively deeper notes.  
- Add diagrams, cheatsheets, and project links.  
- Expand glossary into a proper mini-encyclopedia.  

This repo will grow as I grow.
